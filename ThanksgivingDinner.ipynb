    "This data analyzes 1058 responses to an online survey data (survey monkey) fielded in 2015 regarding what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.  The data comes from https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/.  The results of the analysis should be interpreted with caution as the responses are likely biased since the main mechanism through which it was executed was via online.  It is likely that the population that responds is more computer saavy, younger and more educated than the standard person in the population.  Nevertheless it does allow us to explore some of the regional differences in behavior (that are also correlated with the make-up and demographics of the population)."
